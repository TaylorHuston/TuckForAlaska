Hard work, dedication and the will to succeed are the values that pioneered Alaska. I’ve learned quite
a bit about these over the years, and I owe much of it to my son and my experience serving Alaska.
I was born in 1966 and came to Alaska as a young boy. After a winter in Tanana, I moved to
Anchorage with my mom and younger brother. I have now been living in South Anchorage for over
46 years. From an early age, I always knew Alaska was where I was going to raise a family.

After graduating from Dimond High in 1984, I attended Arizona State University, and then became
an electrician after attending the Alaska Joint Electrical Apprenticeship Training Program. I went on
to become an instructor at the apprenticeship school and attended the University of Tennessee’s
National Training Institute.

I have worked for over 20 years in the private sector as an electrician, project manager, and trades
instructor. I then worked for 17 years as a business representative for the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers, a job which allowed me to help working families throughout Alaska. Now, I
have Tuck Services, a project consultant company servicing the construction industry.
When my son, Devon, was born 26 years ago, I realized I was responsible for his future. I began
dedicating my life to public service. Ever since, I have devoted my energy to making Alaska a place
where our families flourish and our children grow up with opportunities.

I served on the Anchorage School Board from 2007 until 2009. That was when you, my neighbors,
elected me to represent our area in the State House. For the last two decades, I have had the honor to
guide education and workforce training with numerous organizations, including as former co-chair of
Putting Alaska’s Resources to Work.

As part of my public service, I’ve remained deeply involved with my family, church, and our
community. My faith is an enormous source of strength and inspiration. I have volunteered as a Boys
&amp; Girls Club Soccer Coach, with Anchorage Youth Court, Habitat for Humanity, Christmas in May,
and Proyecto Fe Guatemala Mission Trips.

Alaska is my home and what I love most is the people. My passion is working to build a better
Alaska, for our future. It is an honor and privilege to serve you. <strong>I’m asking for your vote on
